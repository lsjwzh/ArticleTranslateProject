[**Create your REST service with Annotations**](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) (square.github.io) 

Wiring a webservice to your domain models can be a tedious task. Retrofit by the incredible square dev team is a library that helps you to automate as much as possible. You just have to write an interface with annotations and Retrofit is doing the all magic. It's using OkHttp as HTTP Client and gson for serialization and deserialization.

[**OkHttp**](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) (square.github.io) 

OkHttp is a httpclient that doesn't suck. It's the basis for the Retrofit library. If you plan to use it without maven/gradly/ivy be sure that you download the jar with all dependencies inside.
