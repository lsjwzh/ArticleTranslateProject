[**Siminov Android ORM**](http://siminov.github.io/android-orm/) (siminov.github.io) 

Siminov ORM is a open source Object/Relational Mapping solution for Android environments. It maps data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and visa versa). Unfortunately we don't see any tests in the repository so we don't know how stable or robust the library is.
