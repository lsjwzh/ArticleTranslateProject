###LIBRARIES & CODE
---

[**Card Library**](https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/cardslib) (github.com) 

Card Library from Gabriele Mariotti provides an easy way to display a UI Card in your Android app.

[**CWAC-Camera: Taking Pictures made easy**](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera) (github.com) 

Taking pictures or videos using the built-in Camera class directly is not an easy task. It is full of edge and corner cases, not to mention its own set of per-device idiosyncracies. As a result, a ton of code is required to successfully show a preview, take a picture, and take a video. CWAC-Camera is an effort to standardize that "ton of code" and hide it behind a scalable API. Here, "scalable" means "simple things are simple, but complex things may be a bit complex".

###DESIGN

Zurb has released a fantastic set of phone and tablet wireframing templates. This set includes commonly used UI elements for Android Jelly Bean, iOS 7 and Windows 8. You'll find toolbars, navigation, form elements, icons, selectors, lists and much more! The stencils work with Omnigraffle for Mac, Keynote, or your favorite PDF program.
