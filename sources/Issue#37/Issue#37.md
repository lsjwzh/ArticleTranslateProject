###NEWS

[**A Java to iOS Objective-C translator**](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/j2objc-java-to-ios-objective-c.html)(google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk)

J2ObjC is an open-source command-line tool from Google that translates Java code to Objective-C for the iOS (iPhone/iPad) platform. This tool enables Java code to be part of an iOS application's build, as no editing of the generated files is necessary. Since it will not be able to deal with CoreData I'm not sure if it's feasible for production.

 
[**Non-constant Fields in Case Labels**](http://)(tools.android.com)

In a regular Android project, constants in the resource R class are final, however, as of ADT 14, in a library project, they will be declared as non final. The reason the fields are no longer final is that it means that the library jars can be compiled once and reused directly in other projects.
