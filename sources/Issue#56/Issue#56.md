###LIBRARIES & CODE
---

[**Android Network Intents**](https://github.com/pocmo/Android-Network-Intents)(github.com)

An interesting library comes from Sebastian Kaspari. Android Network Intents is a library to send Android Intent objects to listening apps/devices via multicast (UDP). This library has been written to utilize it for writing simple app or service discovery protocols but as it can be used to send and receive any Intents through the network without knowing the specific receivers. The library comes with an example chat app - I could imagine an Android P2P filesharing app.

[**PostMan (rings twice) Lib**](https://github.com/fedepaol/PostmanLib--Rings-Twice--Android)(github.com)

LibPostman (Rings Twice) for Android is a library intended to make the asynchronous interaction with a remote server easier, without having to deal with all the well known problems related to asynctasks bound to activities.

[**HorizontalDatePicker**](https://github.com/almozavr/HorizontalDatePicker)(github.com)

Simple but yet flexible android date picker view based on horizontal list views.

[**LogCat**](https://github.com/YANOUSHek/LogCat)(github.com)

LogCat is a simple adb logcat viewer written purely in Objective-C and designed with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines in mind. It uses the native GUI views and is a lot nicer for the eyes than Eclipse plugins.
