[**ORMAN Framework**](http://ahmetalpbalkan.com/blog/introducing-orman-framework/)(ahmetalpbalkan.com)

We're pretty sceptical about this library since the blogpost is from 2011, the Github repository seems to be unmaintained and it also has zero test coverage. If you're looking for something more solid you better check out GreenDAO from Greenrobot.
