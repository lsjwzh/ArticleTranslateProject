"Designing For Android: Tips And Techniques" is an in depth blog post with many best practices when designing for Android. Especially when you have to design for multiple resolutions.

In this blog post Jernej Virag explains all the must have libraries a Android developer should know. Very similiar to our toolbox, but great summaries and explanations of each library.

[**Maven and Android series**](http://blog.stylingandroid.com/archives/1122)(blog.stylingandroid.com)

Sixth part of Mark Allisons "Maven and Android" series.

###LIBRARIES & CODE

Synchronized Scrolling by Xavi Rigua is a library project that allows you to have a Synchronized scrolling effect in a view, similar to the one in the GMail app (when you open a conversation with multiple messages, you can scroll down and the senders info stay on top of screen).

[**Android-Simple-Social-Sharing**](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Simple-Social-Sharing)(github.com)

###NEWS

[**Writing Style**](http://developer.android.com/design/style/writing.html)(developer.android.com)

An official writing style guide has been released by Google. Most of it is common sense, but it is a good nudge to revisit your copy.

 
###TOOLS
---

[**9Patch Resizer**](http://code.google.com/p/9patch-resizer/)(code.google.com)

Let's face it: Juggling with densities for Android is a bit of a pain, especially when dealing with 9 patch png. And then comes this tool, that takes a xhdpi PNG file, or 9.png file, and generates ldpi, mdpi and hdpi png files automatically. Great work!
